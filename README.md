# Python Notebooks for Article X

This repository contains the Python notebooks used for the analyses presented in **Article X**. The notebooks demonstrate simulations and visualizations related to light propagation and scattering.  

## Notebooks

1. **[Introduc.ipynb](./Introduc.ipynb)**  
   This notebook presents simulations of light propagation over a 1D object using Fourier optics. Images and visualizations of the light field are included.

2. **[MieFigure.ipynb](./MieFIgure.ipynb)**  
   This notebook demonstrates how to calculate light propagation using **Mie scattering** theory.  

3. **[ComparaCirc-Esf.ipynb](./ComparaCirc-Esf.ipynb)**  
   This notebook contains comparisons between the well-known 1D bright spot model and 3D propagation using Mie scattering.
